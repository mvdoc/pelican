Writing content
###############

Articles and pages
==================

Pelican considers "articles" to be chronological content, such as posts on a
blog, and thus associated with a date.

The idea behind "pages" is that they are usually not temporal in nature and are
used for content that does not change very often (e.g., "About" or "Contact"
pages).

.. _internal_metadata:

File metadata
=============

Pelican tries to be smart enough to get the information it needs from the
file system (for instance, about the category of your articles), but some
information you need to provide in the form of metadata inside your files.

If you are writing your content in reStructuredText format, you can provide
this metadata in text files via the following syntax (give your file the
``.rst`` extension)::

    My super title
    ##############

    :date: 2010-10-03 10:20
    :modified: 2010-10-04 18:40
    :tags: thats, awesome
    :category: yeah
    :slug: my-super-post
    :authors: Alexis Metaireau, Conan Doyle
    :summary: Short version for index and feeds

Pelican implements an extension to reStructuredText to enable support for the
``abbr`` HTML tag. To use it, write something like this in your post::

    This will be turned into :abbr:`HTML (HyperText Markup Language)`.

You can also use Markdown syntax (with a file ending in ``.md``,
``.markdown``, ``.mkd``, or ``.mdown``). Markdown generation requires that you
first explicitly install the ``Markdown`` package, which can be done via ``pip
install Markdown``. Metadata syntax for Markdown posts should follow this
pattern::

    Title: My super title
    Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
    Modified: 2010-12-05 19:30
    Category: Python
    Tags: pelican, publishing
    Slug: my-super-post
    Authors: Alexis Metaireau, Conan Doyle
    Summary: Short version for index and feeds

    This is the content of my super blog post.

Readers for additional formats (such as AsciiDoc_) are available via plugins.
Refer to `pelican-plugins`_ repository for those.

Pelican can also process HTML files ending in ``.html`` and ``.htm``. Pelican
interprets the HTML in a very straightforward manner, reading metadata from
``meta`` tags, the title from the ``title`` tag, and the body out from the
``body`` tag::

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>My super title</title>
            <meta name="tags" content="thats, awesome" />
            <meta name="date" content="2012-07-09 22:28" />
            <meta name="modified" content="2012-07-10 20:14" />
            <meta name="category" content="yeah" />
            <meta name="authors" content="Alexis Métaireau, Conan Doyle" />
            <meta name="summary" content="Short version for index and feeds" />
        </head>
        <body>
            This is the content of my super blog post.
        </body>
    </html>

With HTML, there is one simple exception to the standard metadata: ``tags`` can
be specified either via the ``tags`` metadata, as is standard in Pelican, or
via the ``keywords`` metadata, as is standard in HTML. The two can be used
interchangeably.

Note that, aside from the title, none of this article metadata is mandatory:
if the date is not specified and ``DEFAULT_DATE`` is set to ``fs``, Pelican
will rely on the file's "mtime" timestamp, and the category can be determined
by the directory in which the file resides. For example, a file located at
``python/foobar/myfoobar.rst`` will have a category of ``foobar``. If you would
like to organize your files in other ways where the name of the subfolder would
not be a good category name, you can set the setting ``USE_FOLDER_AS_CATEGORY``
to ``False``.  When parsing dates given in the page metadata, Pelican supports
the W3C's `suggested subset ISO 8601`__.

__ `W3C ISO 8601`_

``modified`` should be last time you updated the article, and defaults to ``date`` if not specified.
Besides you can show ``modified`` in the templates, feed entries in feed readers will be updated automatically
when you set ``modified`` to the current date after you modified your article.

``authors`` is a comma-separated list of article authors. If there's only one author you
can use ``author`` field.

If you do not explicitly specify summary metadata for a given post, the
``SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH`` setting can be used to specify how many words from the
beginning of an article are used as the summary.

You can also extract any metadata from the filename through a regular
expression to be set in the ``FILENAME_METADATA`` setting. All named groups
that are matched will be set in the metadata object. The default value for the
``FILENAME_METADATA`` setting will only extract the date from the filename. For
example, if you would like to extract both the date and the slug, you could set
something like: ``'(?P<date>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})_(?P<slug>.*)'``

Please note that the metadata available inside your files takes precedence over
the metadata extracted from the filename.

Pages
=====

If you create a folder named ``pages`` inside the content folder, all the
files in it will be used to generate static pages, such as **About** or
**Contact** pages. (See example filesystem layout below.)

You can use the ``DISPLAY_PAGES_ON_MENU`` setting to control whether all those
pages are displayed in the primary navigation menu. (Default is ``True``.)

If you want to exclude any pages from being linked to or listed in the menu
then add a ``status: hidden`` attribute to its metadata. This is useful for
things like making error pages that fit the generated theme of your site.

.. _ref-linking-to-internal-content:

Linking to internal content
===========================

From Pelican 3.1 onwards, it is now possible to specify intra-site links to
files in the *source content* hierarchy instead of files in the *generated*
hierarchy. This makes it easier to link from the current post to other posts
and images that may be sitting alongside the current post (instead of having
to determine where those resources will be placed after site generation).

To link to internal content (files in the ``content`` directory), use the
following syntax: ``{filename}path/to/file``::


    website/
    ├── content
    │   ├── article1.rst
    │   ├── cat/
    │   │   └── article2.md
    │   └── pages
    │       └── about.md
    └── pelican.conf.py

In this example, ``article1.rst`` could look like::

    The first article
    #################

    :date: 2012-12-01 10:02

    See below intra-site link examples in reStructuredText format.

    `a link relative to content root <{filename}/cat/article2.rst>`_
    `a link relative to current file <{filename}cat/article2.rst>`_

and ``article2.md``::

    Title: The second article
    Date: 2012-12-01 10:02

    See below intra-site link examples in Markdown format.

    [a link relative to content root]({filename}/article1.md)
    [a link relative to current file]({filename}../article1.md)

Embedding non-article or non-page content is slightly different in that the
directories need to be specified in ``pelicanconf.py`` file. The ``images``
directory is configured for this by default but others will need to be added
manually::

    content
    ├── images
    │   └── han.jpg
    └── misc
        └── image-test.md

And ``image-test.md`` would include::

    ![Alt Text]({filename}/images/han.jpg)

Any content can be linked in this way. What happens is that the ``images``
directory gets copied to ``output/`` during site generation because Pelican
includes ``images`` in the ``STATIC_PATHS`` setting's list by default. If
you want to have another directory, say ``pdfs``, copied from your content to
your output during site generation, you would need to add the following to
your settings file::

    STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'pdfs']

After the above line has been added, subsequent site generation should copy the
``content/pdfs/`` directory to ``output/pdfs/``.

You can also link to categories or tags, using the ``{tag}tagname`` and
``{category}foobar`` syntax.

For backward compatibility, Pelican also supports bars (``||``) in addition to
curly braces (``{}``). For example: ``|filename|an_article.rst``,
``|tag|tagname``, ``|category|foobar``. The syntax was changed from ``||`` to
``{}`` to avoid collision with Markdown extensions or reST directives.

Importing an existing site
==========================

It is possible to import your site from WordPress, Tumblr, Dotclear, and RSS
feeds using a simple script. See :ref:`import`.

Translations
============

It is possible to translate articles. To do so, you need to add a ``lang`` meta
attribute to your articles/pages and set a ``DEFAULT_LANG`` setting (which is
English [en] by default). With those settings in place, only articles with the
default language will be listed, and each article will be accompanied by a list
of available translations for that article.

Pelican uses the article's URL "slug" to determine if two or more articles are
translations of one another. The slug can be set manually in the file's
metadata; if not set explicitly, Pelican will auto-generate the slug from the
title of the article.

Here is an example of two articles, one in English and the other in French.

The English article::

    Foobar is not dead
    ##################

    :slug: foobar-is-not-dead
    :lang: en

    That's true, foobar is still alive!

And the French version::

    Foobar n'est pas mort !
    #######################

    :slug: foobar-is-not-dead
    :lang: fr

    Oui oui, foobar est toujours vivant !

Post content quality notwithstanding, you can see that only item in common
between the two articles is the slug, which is functioning here as an
identifier. If you'd rather not explicitly define the slug this way, you must
then instead ensure that the translated article titles are identical, since the
slug will be auto-generated from the article title.

If you do not want the original version of one specific article to be detected
by the ``DEFAULT_LANG`` setting, use the ``translation`` metadata to specify
which posts are translations::

    Foobar is not dead
    ##################

    :slug: foobar-is-not-dead
    :lang: en
    :translation: true

    That's true, foobar is still alive!


.. _internal_pygments_options:

Syntax highlighting
===================

Pelican is able to provide colorized syntax highlighting for your code blocks.
To do so, you have to use the following conventions inside your content files.

For reStructuredText, use the code-block directive::

    .. code-block:: identifier

       <indented code block goes here>

For Markdown, include the language identifier just above the code block,
indenting both the identifier and code::

    A block of text.

        :::identifier
        <code goes here>

The specified identifier (e.g. ``python``, ``ruby``) should be one that
appears on the `list of available lexers <http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/>`_.

When using reStructuredText the following options are available in the
code-block directive:

=============   ============  =========================================
Option          Valid values  Description
=============   ============  =========================================
anchorlinenos   N/A           If present wrap line numbers in <a> tags.
classprefix     string        String to prepend to token class names
hl_lines        numbers       List of lines to be highlighted.
lineanchors     string        Wrap each line in an anchor using this
                              string and -linenumber.
linenos         string        If present or set to "table" output line
                              numbers in a table, if set to
                              "inline" output them inline. "none" means
                              do not output the line numbers for this
                              table.
linenospecial   number        If set every nth line will be given the
                              'special' css class.
linenostart     number        Line number for the first line.
linenostep      number        Print every nth line number.
lineseparator   string        String to print between lines of code,
                              '\n' by default.
linespans       string        Wrap each line in a span using this and
                              -linenumber.
nobackground    N/A           If set do not output background color for
                              the wrapping element
nowrap          N/A           If set do not wrap the tokens at all.
tagsfile        string        ctags file to use for name definitions.
tagurlformat    string        format for the ctag links.
=============   ============  =========================================

Note that, depending on the version, your Pygments module might not have
all of these options available. Refer to the *HtmlFormatter* section of the
`Pygments documentation <http://pygments.org/docs/formatters/>`_ for more
details on each of the options.

For example, the following code block enables line numbers, starting at 153,
and prefixes the Pygments CSS classes with *pgcss* to make the names
more unique and avoid possible CSS conflicts::

    .. code-block:: identifier
        :classprefix: pgcss
        :linenos: table
        :linenostart: 153

       <indented code block goes here>

It is also possible to specify the ``PYGMENTS_RST_OPTIONS`` variable in your
Pelican settings file to include options that will be automatically applied to
every code block.

For example, if you want to have line numbers displayed for every code block
and a CSS prefix you would set this variable to::

    PYGMENTS_RST_OPTIONS = {'classprefix': 'pgcss', 'linenos': 'table'}

If specified, settings for individual code blocks will override the defaults in
your settings file.

Publishing drafts
=================

If you want to publish an article as a draft (for friends to review before
publishing, for example), you can add a ``Status: draft`` attribute to its
metadata. That article will then be output to the ``drafts`` folder and not
listed on the index page nor on any category or tag page.
